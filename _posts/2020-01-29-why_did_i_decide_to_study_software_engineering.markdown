Growing up I have loved technology from the time I can remember. I think I was born at the perfect time, though I am slightly envious of the younger generation and how tech is created to be easy for them, I digress. As a kid, I remember dial-up internet or picking up the house phone and hearing "the internet".  I remember when the first The Sims came out and falling in love with video games. I appreciate the evolution. And as technology evolved so has my love for it.

I remember my uncle taking me to buy my first iMac. This is when you could pick the color. I picked the turquoise g3. I LOVED IT. Now at the age of 7 what all could I do with it? I can't even remember but I was on it every single day.  Then the iPhone came out and BOY was like WHAT IS THIS?!?!?! I fell more in love and as I graduated high school, I decided I wanted to be a..... doctor.  So I went to the University of Connecticut Pre-Med..... short-lived. I then changed my major to Business Finance and at that time I got a full-time job working in IT and my education took a back seat.


Fast forward 2019 I find myself in a Desktop Support role for the California State University System, and I love the company but I don't love the idea of being in this role for 10+ years. I want to grow and maneuver throughout the company and have my own company at the same time. I give my back story to say that technology and soccer were my first loves. Unfortunately due to injuries, I couldn't continue my soccer career but software engineering is my second act. I've always loved to learn, and always want to understand how things work. I also feel like I have the idea of the century but never have a way to implement it. 

Flatiron has made my hope possible. I hope to become a well-versed software engineer who can inspire kids that look like me to see that they can do it too. I want to be able to think of an idea and say "let's make that" I want to be able to have the tools to change the world if I can. I want to create reality and I cannot wait until my thoughts become concrete. I'm so excited for this journey.
